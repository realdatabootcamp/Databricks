# Databricks General Concepts  

Databricks is a cloud-based **big data analytics platform** built on **Apache Spark**, designed for data engineering, machine learning, and business intelligence. It enables scalable data processing and collaborative workflows.

## 1. Core Components of Databricks  
- **Apache Spark Runtime** – Optimized Spark environment with enhanced performance.  
- **Delta Lake** – ACID-compliant data storage for handling big data.  
- **Databricks SQL** – Enables **SQL-based querying** for analytics and BI tools.  
- **Unified Data Platform** – Combines **ETL, ML, AI, and reporting** in a single workspace.  

## 2. Compute & Architecture  
- **Databricks Clusters** – Distributed computing environment for running Spark jobs.  
- **Medallion Architecture** – Organizes data into **Bronze (raw), Silver (processed), and Gold (aggregated)** layers.  
- **Databricks Workflows** – Orchestrates automated **ETL pipelines, ML models, and reporting**.  
- **Databricks Runtime** – Pre-configured Spark environments with performance enhancements.  

## 3. Data Processing & ETL  
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** – Used to clean and structure data from various sources.  
- **Batch Processing** – Handles large volumes of scheduled data transformations.  
- **Stream Processing** – Enables **real-time data analytics** via Spark Streaming.  
- **Lakehouse Architecture** – Merges **data lakes and warehouses** into a scalable hybrid model.  

## 4. Security & Governance  
- **Access Control** – Managed via **IAM roles, permissions, and RBAC policies**.  
- **Data Lineage & Cataloging** – Organized via **Unity Catalog for metadata management**.  
- **Encryption & Compliance** – Secures sensitive data with **built-in encryption and auditing tools**.  
- **Data Quality Management** – Uses **Great Expectations, Delta Lake constraints**, and validation workflows.  

## 5. Machine Learning & AI Integration  
- **MLflow Integration** – Tracks ML experiments and model versioning.  
- **AutoML** – Automates **feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection**.  
- **Databricks Model Serving** – Deploys ML models for scalable inference.  
- **Graph Processing** – Supports **GraphFrames** for analyzing complex relationships in large datasets.  

## 6. Business Intelligence & Reporting  
- **Databricks SQL Analytics** – SQL-based analysis for structured queries.  
- **BI Tools Integration** – Connects with **Power BI, Tableau, Looker** for visualization.  
- **Advanced Analytics** – Enables forecasting, customer segmentation, and trend analysis.
