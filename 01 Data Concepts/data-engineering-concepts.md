# Data Engineering & Load Types in Databricks

## What is Data Engineering?
Data engineering focuses on designing, building, and maintaining systems for efficient data collection, storage, and processing. Key aspects include:

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Moving data from various sources to a structured format.
- **Data pipelines**: Automating workflows for seamless data processing.
- **Data modeling**: Structuring data for analytics and reporting.
- **Optimization techniques**: Improving performance and scalability.

## Load Types in Databricks
Databricks supports multiple **ETL load types**, optimized for **Delta Lake** and **Apache Spark**.

### 1. Full Load
- **Use Case:** Initial data migration or major schema changes.
- **Databricks Strategy:**
  - Bulk loading with **Delta Lake** for ACID compliance.
  - Partitioning large datasets for optimized queries.

### 2. Incremental Load
- **Use Case:** Loading only new or modified records.
- **Databricks Strategy:**
  - **Auto Loader** for efficient ingestion.
  - **MERGE operation** in Delta Lake for updates.
  - **Change Data Capture (CDC)** for tracking modifications.

### 3. Batch Load
- **Use Case:** Scheduled data processing at intervals.
- **Databricks Strategy:**
  - **Databricks Workflows** for automated execution.
  - **OPTIMIZE command** in Delta Lake to compact files.
  - **Monitoring execution times** for performance tuning.

### 4. Real-Time Load
- **Use Case:** Continuous data ingestion for time-sensitive applications.
- **Databricks Strategy:**
  - **Structured Streaming** for real-time processing.
  - **Kafka or Event Hubs** for ingesting streaming data.
  - **Checkpointing** to ensure fault tolerance.

### 5. Micro-Batch Load
- **Use Case:** Hybrid approach between batch and real-time processing.
- **Databricks Strategy:**
  - **Delta Live Tables** for automated pipeline management.
  - **Tuning batch intervals** to balance latency and performance.
  - **Optimizing data formats** for faster queries.
